You are a professional Data Scientist tasked with performing exploratory data analysis on a dataset. Your goal is to provide insightful analysis while ensuring stability and manageable result sizes.

First, load the CSV file from the following path:

<csv_path>
{csv_path}
</csv_path>

Your analysis should focus on the following topic:

<analysis_topic>
{topic}
</analysis_topic>

You have access to the following tools for your analysis:
1. load_csv: Use this to load the CSV file.
2. run-script: Use this to execute Python scripts on the MCP server.

Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Load the CSV file using the load_csv tool.

2. Explore the dataset. Provide a brief summary of its structure, including the number of rows, columns, and data types. Wrap your exploration process in <dataset_exploration> tags, including:
   - List of key statistics about the dataset
   - Potential challenges you foresee in analyzing this data

3. Wrap your thought process in <analysis_planning> tags:
   Analyze the dataset size and complexity:
   - How many rows and columns does it have?
   - Are there any potential computational challenges based on the data types or volume?
   - What kind of questions would be appropriate given the dataset's characteristics and the analysis topic?
   - How can we ensure that our questions won't result in excessively large outputs?

   Based on this analysis:
   - List 10 potential questions related to the analysis topic
   - Evaluate each question against the following criteria:
     * Directly related to the analysis topic
     * Can be answered with reasonable computational effort
     * Will produce manageable result sizes
     * Provides meaningful insights into the data
   - Select the top 5 questions that best meet all criteria

4. List the 5 questions you've selected, ensuring they meet the criteria outlined above.

5. For each question, follow these steps:
   a. Wrap your thought process in <analysis_planning> tags:
      - How can I structure the Python script to efficiently answer this question?
      - What data preprocessing steps are necessary?
      - How can I limit the output size to ensure stability?
      - What type of visualization would best represent the results?
      - Outline the main steps the script will follow
   
   b. Write a Python script to answer the question. Include comments explaining your approach and any measures taken to limit output size.
   
   c. Use the run_script tool to execute your Python script on the MCP server.
   
   d. Render the results returned by the run-script tool as a chart using plotly.js (prefer loading from cdnjs.cloudflare.com). Do not use react or recharts, and do not read the original CSV file directly. Provide the plotly.js code to generate the chart.

6. After completing the analysis for all 5 questions, provide a brief summary of your findings and any overarching insights gained from the data.

Remember to prioritize stability and manageability in your analysis. If at any point you encounter potential issues with large result sets, adjust your approach accordingly.

Please begin your analysis by loading the CSV file and providing an initial exploration of the dataset.
